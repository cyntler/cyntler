My adventure with programming started when I was 12 years old. From the very beginning I felt that this was a very inspiring activity and it quickly became my passion. I love creating and exploring. Order and consistency, cleanliness of the code is very important to me. The most motivating thing for me in this job is that I, as a creator, can create something for others.
